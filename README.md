Hi, my name is Alyssa Knez. These are the repositories from past and current projects that I have worked on. Many repositories are just a list of scripts that I have contributed to projects.
- I am currently a student at UCF pursuing a Game Design major on the Programming track with a Computing Opportunities for Degree Enhancement (CODE) Minor.
